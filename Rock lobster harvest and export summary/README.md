South Africa's rock lobster (Jasus lalandii) fishery is made up of commercial (individuals and companies) and small-scale (co-operatives and communitis) operators. Long-term fishing rights were allocated in 2017 for a 15-year period. Since the status of the resource is very poor (1.7% of pristine levels), having a broad overview of the basic activity levels in the fishery will be useful. 

The activation of permits, number of vessels active, landings and overcatch, and exports have been queried in MySQL and summarised in tables and graphs. 

The .csv files hold the raw data, 'WCRL permits landings exports 11Mar.sql' has the queries and the plot is published on Tableau Public:
