Two tables contain data on permits:
1. permitholder_rightholder.csv = permit holder and the right holder that appears on each permit
2. permitholder_status_date.csv = permit holder and the dates and status associated with each permit

Calculate the turnaround time (date created to date started) for each permit per sector. Sector 1 (IR community) contains the name 'community' in the right holder name, and Sector 2 (commercial) does not contain 'community'. 

The weekends and public holidays must be deducted from the turnaround time to produce number of working days.
